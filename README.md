 the name of the game is bit-planes


dis is gam ting
please use nintendo :(

do not run wthout the svg or js files, it will not work, dont even try boi

This is not an online game, it will work offline. so no need for a open port.

do give credit :)

dont do an embed make it open in a new tab embeding it will break it. just imprt the files into your site rename the index.html from here to something diffent so it does not interfere with your othre html, also make sure to chage the name in the js files.

do not put the svg files in a folder, you will need to change the path of the file, and there is a lot so just dont make yourself do more work, i mean if you want to you can.
